          <p>An African lion cub rests in the tall grasses of Botswana’s Okavango Delta. Once ranging across the African continent and into Syria, Israel, Iraq, Pakistan, Iran, and even northwest India, lions have declined to as few as 20,000 animals from about 450,000 just 50 years ago.</p>

        <li><h3>Asiatic Leopard cub</h3>

          <p>An Asiatic leopard cub in the Hukawng Valley in Myanmar (Burma) became an orphan after hunters killed its mother to sell her body parts for use in traditional medicine. In 2010, the entire valley—about the size of Vermont—was designated by the government of Myanmar as a tiger sanctuary, a major conservation step that protects big cats and other rare species throughout the territory.</p>

        <li><h3>King Cheetah cub</h3>

          <p>Still just a prince, a rare king cheetah is the result of a recessive gene. Except for darker, elongated spots, king cheetahs are genetically identical to other cheetahs. The genetic homogeneity of cheetah populations may make them more vulnerable to disease</p>
